## Rainbow Drop

This is a game I built for the Global Game Jam Singapore.

The theme for 2024 was 'Make Me Laugh'. I was inspired by some of the particularly hard games like I Wanna be the Guy, The Password Game and Syobon no Action. The funny part is how ridiculously hard it is to advance and the unexpected ways the player dies.

With this concept, I tried to do a twist on Tetris. I wanted to surprise the player but it didn't turn out very well, and I don't think it's funny because the surprises were strategic rather than action-based.

I initially wanted to allow destruction of rows and continuation of the same level after, but after trying it, it's too hard and takes too long for play testing.

The amazing part was that I managed to submit something functional within the deadline.

## Twists

Every level has a surprise or two for the player. These are all spoilers.

Level 0: The sky falls as you play, so the game tries to kill you faster than you think. Also, the limit of the playing field is not the brick ceiling, but the sky.

Level 1: An additional colour is added, which makes it difficult to form a line. You can now pass through the left and right walls though, and there's an invisible floor out of view. I use the extra space to stack blocks I don't want.

Level 2: More colours, and they're similar, so it might be tricky to identify the colour within a short time span?

Level 3: Rotation mechanics have been changed, so you have to hold down the key for rotation.

Level 4: An error window pops up every so often, and your keys don't work while the window is open! Your block continues dropping while you struggle to find the close button..! Congratulations if you clear this level. That's all the levels I built.
